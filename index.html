Without getting too existential, obtaining happiness and prosperity has to be the driving factor behind what gets us out of bed everyday. I mean, why else would we exist and suffer the turmoil of everyday life, if not to chase the metaphorical carrot on a stick that is just being happy?</p>\n<p>But what does that even mean? How do you even quantify something as immeasurable as an emotion? What if your idea of being happy is different to my perception of it?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*nfReVYgJiLfCrA2EVUwJZA.jpeg\" alt=\"I dunno\" width=\"276\" height=\"184\"></p>\n<p>It’s impossible to say, but it’s just as easy to determine whether you’re not happy. You’d just know, right? That empty feeling in your stomach, that ever present numbness that sits where your heart should be, the lack of motivation, the constant search for something that you cannot even begin to identify…&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This isn’t depression that I’m talking about, which is a different topic all together, one that I am in no way qualified to talk about. But if your life is going reasonably well, and you have no clear reason to be unhappy, yet you still unmistakably&nbsp;are, then what? What’s missing?</p>\n<p>Finding an answer is a deeply personal journey, so there is no one-size-fits-all solution. I can only present to you my accumulation of study and opinion of the mechanisms by which we can reach the nirvana of contentment.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, science has already done most of the work for us. There is a branch of science called Positive Psychology, which is simply the study of what makes us happy. Neat, thanks science! Everybody say “Thank you science.”</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,h_3241,w_5760,x_0,y_61/f_auto,q_auto,w_1100/v1554926640/shape/mentalfloss/istock-655728728.jpg\" alt=\"Thank you science...\" width=\"467\" height=\"263\"></p>\n<p>So what does being happy mean? Is it “feeling” happy all the time? Is it merely your brain chemistry, or the baseline amount of serotonin and dopamine swimming around your head at any given moment? Does that determine how happy we are?</p>\n<p>The answer is… maybe. There are “methods” of upping that baseline, but I would not recommend that route. After all, unless you’re suffering from a chemical imbalance, those chemicals are only a result of what is happening in your life.</p>\n<p>When you fall in love with someone, you feel like you’re on cloud nine. As your brain squirms in pleasure from all the dopamine, you think to yourself, “I’m so happy right now! This is what happiness must feel like.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And then the honeymoon phase is over, or you break up, and your brain is all of a sudden deprived of those very chemicals. If you’re going through a break up, it can feel like you’re withdrawing from a very addictive drug. Because, well, that’s exactly what’s happening. Your body is acclimating itself to its new baseline. But eventually, it will, and you’ll be able to function normally again.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.tenor.com/images/cea9479280713716b78b7cf9cb434a20/tenor.png\" alt=\"Mostly\"></p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Mostly...</em></pre>\n<p>Which raises the question, what were you before this person came into your life? Sure, you were “happy” and carefree for a bit while you were together, but does that mean your happiness is dependent on the presence of this person? That doesn’t sound right.</p>\n<p>So the next logical line of thinking is that your happiness is dependent on how satisfied you are with your life. You have goals, things which you’d like to achieve in your short time on this earth, and thus the pursuit of those goals will result in eternal happiness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This I think is closer to the truth, but it’s not the whole truth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Say you’ve finally achieved this goal of yours. You’ve landed your dream job, you passed the exam, you hit your goal weight, whatever. Congrats! I’m proud of you.</p>\n<p>In reality what happens is that you feel a momentary burst of happiness on achieving this goal. This can last a day, a week, a month even. But this, too, is temporary. It has to be.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because you can’t ever be fully satisfied with your life. It’s impossible. You always need to be in pursuit of something, otherwise what’s the point? You reach your goal, and then, what, just give up? That just isn’t how humans operate. We always, always, want what we cannot have, and we eventually become dissatisfied with what we do have.</p>\n<p>It’s a nasty, endless cycle, but a necessary one.</p>\n<p>At this point we can probably construct an empty platitude along the lines of “Happiness is about the pursuit of happiness”. Well, isn’t that profound and meaningful!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.intofilm.org/intofilm-production/scaledcropped/1096x548https%3A/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images.cdn.filmclub.org/film__3143-the-pursuit-of-happyness--hi_res-008f2e57.jpg/film__3143-the-pursuit-of-happyness--hi_res-008f2e57.jpg\" alt=\"Happiness?\" width=\"384\" height=\"192\"></p>\n<p>But like I said, it’s not the whole truth. You can spend your entire life in pursuit of something while being completely miserable the entire time.</p>\n<p>The point I’m trying to make is that life is always fluctuating. There will always be external factors outside of our control that affects how happy or sad we feel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So we can either ride the waves of life, accepting of everything that it throws our way, and allow it to determine how happy we feel at any given moment.</p>\n<p>Or we can look internally.</p>\n<p>If happiness is really simply about chemicals, surely there’s some way in which we can “hack” the complex system that is our brain? What if we could take the enormous ecstasy we feel when we accomplish something, and feel that way all the time? Wouldn’t that be amazing?</p>\n<p>Think about it: your goals are artificial. They’re given value by you. Getting that job is important to you because you’ve decided it’s important. That was a conscious choice, was it not? It’s all arbitrary. Sure, there’s reasons stacked upon reasons for why things are important to you, but it’s really just your own construction.</p>\n<p>So why not just always be happy? It’s all in your head. You could decide to be happy simply because you’re alive. Your life is miraculous on its own. Your body is the most complex piece of technology in the entire universe, and it runs without you even consciously thinking about it. Isn’t that something to be happy about?</p>\n<p>If the force of gravity was a only a fraction weaker than it currently is, our planet would not have been able to form all those billions of years ago. Which means that our solar system is inch perfect, and that if it wasn’t, life would probably not exist. I guess that’s something to be grateful for.</p>\n<p>But I’m not here to tell you that you should just be happy to be alive, only that, if you so choose, you could. So is happiness… a choice?</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4db/9a9/78f0f50285dd11bef4946bc47283e49281-pills-lede.rhorizontal.w1200.jpg\" alt=\"Red or blue?\" width=\"455\" height=\"303\"></p>\n<p>Here’s another thought experiment: think about the most embarrassing moment in your entire life. For me, it was when I accidentally flashed a couple of old women in Mecca. Anyway, you’re probably flushing and feeling a deep sense of embarrassment at the mere thought of this incident. So it stands to reason that your emotions are a consequence of your thoughts.</p>\n<p>Which means that you can feel whatever you want to feel, as long as you can control your thoughts. Yes, you can control your thoughts! Because you aren’t your thoughts. Most people don’t know this, but there is a separation between your thoughts and your consciousness. It’s possible to merely observe whatever you’re thinking without letting it affect how you feel.</p>\n<p>That may sound like nothing, but learning of that fact can act as a lightswitch and change your entire life. Because it doesn’t even occur to most people that their thoughts are not representative of who you are. It’s just a voice inside your head, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>Being aware of your thoughts and ruminating on your being, this is called mindfulness. There’s only about like a thousand books written on it.</p>\n<p>So as you can probably see by now, this is a complicated topic, and you’re not going to get stone cold answers anywhere, even from science. But I’ll attempt to give some semblance of answer.</p>\n<p>True happiness is a mindset.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://optometrydivas.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mindset-is-everything.jpg\"></p>\n<p>If life is indeed a series of waves, you need to plant your feet in the sand and let those waves flow through you. Your mindset will anchor you as the waves pull and crash around you.</p>\n<p>Because being happy is really all just about how we respond to life.</p>\n<p>As Marcus Aurelius says in his book Meditations, “You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”</p>\n<p>With this philosophy, the external world becomes irrelevant. Happiness becomes dependant solely on the quality of your thoughts.</p>\n<p>Why is it that people living in poverty, with a fraction of the opportunities and blessings that we have received, are able to lead joyful, fulfilling lives, when others with so much in their possession cannot? This is the true meaning of materialism, seeking from the outside world. It needs to come from within.</p>\n<p>But we’re all about practicality over here, so I’m not going to leave you with that bullshit. There are fundamental things that we can do to improve the quality of lives, which are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sleep</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’m not going to list the dozens of ways in which an activity we spend a third of our lives doing is important, so I’ll just link&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-reasons-why-good-sleep-is-important\">this</a>&nbsp;article.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Exercise</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember those chemicals I was talking about? One of the best, most natural ways to get a hit of serotonin is good exercise. Exercise not only benefits your physical body, but your mind as well. So on top of the self-esteem boost that comes with looking good, you’re also increasing your brainpower, your overall mood and the amount of energy you have.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Meditation</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Honestly, the #1 most effective method for improving yourself, and if there’s one thing you take from this blog, it’s that meditation can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://positivepsychology.com/benefits-of-meditation/\">change your life</a>. There’s nothing mystical about it either.</p>\n<p>Meditation allows you to quiet your mind. It lets you be in the moment, feeling every itch and sensation permeating through your body. For however long you meditate, the outside world falls away, and you’re left with a wonderful feeling of tranquility.</p>\n<p>Think of it like a muscle that needs to be trained. When you’re living your life and you can feel that your thoughts are going in a direction that you don’t want it to, you can control those thoughts, look at them from outside and keep them from swallowing you whole.</p>\n<p>It is only a tool for you to control your mind, but there are none better.</p>\n<p>I must stress that if you have problems in your life that are directly affecting your overall happiness, you need to deal with those first before any of these can help you.</p>\n<p>But I hope that this piece will assist you on your journey towards peace and prosperity. I truly wish that I had discovered these insights when I was younger, long before I was exiled out of Mecca for public indecency. That shit was crazy.</p>\n<div class=\"ps__rail-x\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>
